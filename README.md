# Atlas

Atlas is a set of NixOS modules which can configure both NixOS options and Home Manager options in the same file.

This flake exposes NixOS configurations for the systems I manage with Nix, as well as the Atlas modules.

## Usage

* Activate a configuration for the current host with `just activate`
* Update Flake inputs with `just update`
